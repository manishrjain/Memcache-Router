=======================
ZMQ (and for Protobuf)
-----------------------
You'd want to build both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the library. 32 bit libraries should go into lib32, and 64 bit into lib (or lib64). This is how you'd compile a 32-bit version, after download zmq package.

$ make clean  # Always remember to make clean.
$ CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32" ./configure --prefix=/tmp/zmq && make && make install
# You might also have to include -fPIC as a flag for gcc/g++ above to make cmrclient compile.

Finally copy them over.
$ cd /tmp/zmq/lib && cp -dR . ~/ans/memcache_router/lib32/  # -d option preserves links.

You should double check that the libraries are infact 32 bit. Here's what it shows for protobuf installation.
$ file -L libprotobuf.so
libprotobuf.so: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, not stripped

Without the CC and CXX flags, ./configure would automatically set 64 bit options, because dev boxes in Quora are 64-bit.
Befor compiling 64 bit versions, remember to 
$ make clean.

=======================
Pybindgen
-----------------------
This package depends upon:
https://code.google.com/p/pybindgen/

Download the tar from the site, unpackage it. It should have waf binary within the package.

You can configure it as such:
PYTHON=/home/manish/ans/venv/bin/python2.7 ./waf configure --prefix=/tmp/pybindgen
./waf
./waf install

This would now add a sitepackage in /tmp:
/tmp/pybindgen/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pybindgen/

You can copy over pybindgen site-package into this directory, so that compile script can use it.
